# pc_nas

This contains the source code for the project called PCNAS : Probabilistic circuits neural architecture search as part of my research internship at CTU Prague. 
Here we tried to learn an optimal graph structure of probabilistic circuit using typical nas framework, using graph convolutional neural networks and policy gradient reinforcement strategy.
